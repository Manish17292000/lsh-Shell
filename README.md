    * setenv var [value]                        - sets the value of the environment variable specified by var (create if it does not exist) to [value].

    * kjob <jobNumber> <signalNumber>           - takes the job id of a running job and sends a signal value to that process
    * fg <jobNumber>                            - brings a running or a stopped background job with a given job number to background
    * bg <jobNumber>                            - changes a stopped background job to a running background job
    * overkill                                  - kills all background process at once
    * CTRL-Z                                    - changes the status of currently running job to stop, and pushes it in background process
